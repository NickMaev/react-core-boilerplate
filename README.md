﻿[![Build Status](https://trixonsystems.visualstudio.com/React%20Core%20Boilerplate/_apis/build/status/NickMaev.react-core-boilerplate?branchName=master)](https://trixonsystems.visualstudio.com/React%20Core%20Boilerplate/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

# Description
**React Core Boilerplate** is a starting point for building universal/isomorphic React web applications with ASP.NET Core 3 and server-side rendering. All works fine out of the box. It also is helpful for newbies.
The project contains a fake authorization system. So you can change it to Identity or the other.  
[TypeScript](https://github.com/NickMaev/react-core-boilerplate/tree/master/RCB.TypeScript) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/NickMaev/react-core-boilerplate/tree/master/RCB.JavaScript) versions are available.⚡️

# Usage

## Installation
1. Install v3 of .NET Core **SDK** and **Runtime** by [link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
2. Install v14 of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. At the first run you must close the project if it runs in Visual Studio or another IDE. 
Open project's folder in console and run command `npm install`.
4. Execute the following command for development in your project's directory. It will compile the main and vendor bundle.
```bash 
npm run build:dev
```
5. If you are using Visual Studio 20xx, instead of `IIS Express` select the `YourProjectName` or `ReactCoreBoilerplate`: 
click on the down arrow near the `IIS Express` and choose Docker or other option.
6. Build and run project. It will start in Windows Console.

## Modify WebPack vendor config
If you modify the WebPack vendor config, you must manually recompile the vendor bundle.
Execute the following command in your project's directory to do this:
```bash
npm run build:dev
```

## Run with Docker

### Visual Studio 20xx
Just select the `Docker` option in the toolbar.

### Build a container
Execute the following command in your project's directory:
```bash
docker build -t [my image name] . 
```
where `[my image name]` is your Docker image name.

### Run a production container on Windows with HTTPS support (for test)
1. Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Windows and macOS:
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p [my password]
```  
where `[my password]` is your password.  
2. Execute:
```bash
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```
3. Build your container.  
4. Execute:  
```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 7000:7000 -p 7001:7001 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="[my password]" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https:/https/ [my image name]
```  
where `[my password]` - your certificate password (from the 1st step), `[my image name]` - your Docker image name.

# Issues

## Known issues

* **ERROR in ./ClientApp/styles/loaders/xxx.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js![...]): Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir 'xxx\node_modules\node-sass\vendor'**

* **HTTP Error 500**  
Probably you don't have the latest version of Node.js.

* **HTTP Error 502.5**  
You must install the latest "ASP.NET Core SDK" and "Runtime and Hosting Bundle" using this link: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1

* **HTTP error 500 when hosted in Azure**  
Set the "WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION" to 6.11.2 in the "app settings" in Azure.
